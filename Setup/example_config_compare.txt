# The region that you wish to inspect. It is recommended that you pick a region
# that is mainly characterised by peaks in your reference dataset. A larger
# region will result in slowdown.

# The cutoff that was used when peak calling with the reference dataset
# Recall that this isn't the actual value, but the -log() value of the cutoff
# meaning 5 is actually 1e-5.
CUTOFF=5

# This is the signficance used for confidence intervals. Using a higher value
# leads to tighter confidence intervals, leading to being more stringent on
# pseudopeaks.
SIGNIFICANCE=0.95

# This is the window to use when calculating confidence intervals for the
# bias track. A larger window will generally lead to poor confidence intervals.
# In general this value should be somewhere between a quarter and half of the
# fragment length of each sample.
WINDOW_SIZE=50

# If you want to know what the metric evaluates to without factoring in peaks
# that are called due to MACS3 merging close peaks, set this to 1.

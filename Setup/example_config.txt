# To estimate the fragment length, read length and get the number of reads
# in your input files, MACS3 can build a model. If you already know these
# values or want to play around with manual values, turn BUILD_MODEL off by
# setting it to 0.

# Given genome size is for human. You don't need to be 100% accurate here, it

# Cutoff analysis is a part of the pipeline. If you want to use a custom
